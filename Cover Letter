Hello Mr Lobban

As you are aware, I have been talking to Keith in regards to gaining some work experience in the computing field.
I have attatched some of my current work for collage which is in Visual Basic alongside other work in c#.
The c# work is something that I have had to learn seperate from my studies in order to complete an asignments for college.
I am extremely keen on getting some real world experience and hope that the work that I have attatched is sufficient for your requirements.
If you require any further clarification or have any questions in regards to my work or the attachments, please do not hesitate to get in touch.

Sincerely
Kai McGinty
