In regards to Programming, I have roughly 8 or so months experience in visual basic and roughly 4 months in c# in order to program my video game in unity.
The scripts from the video game have been uploaded for you to look through.
I would be more than willing to learn more c# or any other programming language that is required.
I have a reasonable understanding of other simple software aplications such as microsoft word, powerpoint and access and would be more than happy to learn how to use other industry standard software.

The "sorts and searches" file is in visual basic and the "Scripts" file is in c#
